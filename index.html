Overview


Before you begin: Before you start using the Maps JavaScript API, you need a project with a billing account and the Maps JavaScript API enabled. To learn more, see Get Started with Google Maps Platform.
The Maps JavaScript API lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display on web pages and mobile devices. The Maps JavaScript API features four basic map types (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain) which you can modify using layers and styles, controls and events, and various services and libraries.

Audience
This documentation is designed for people familiar with JavaScript programming and object-oriented programming concepts. You should also be familiar with Google Maps from a user's point of view. There are many JavaScript tutorials available on the Web.

This conceptual documentation is designed to let you quickly start exploring and developing applications with the Maps JavaScript API. We also publish the Maps JavaScript API Reference.

Hello, World
The easiest way to start learning about the Maps JavaScript API is to see a simple example. The following example displays a map centered on Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
